This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone elseâ€™s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you.

HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites.\n","\n","Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n","\n","Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n","\n","A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y-PeNOVnOp7q"},"source":["### Question 2.1: Basic HTTP Requests w/o authentication **(5%)**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K5oDXLwJOp7q"},"source":["First, let's do the \"hello world\" of making web requests with Python to get a sense for how to programmatically access web pages: an (unauthenticated) HTTP GET to download a web page.\n","\n","Fill in the funtion to use `requests` to download and return the raw HTML content of the URL passed in as an argument.
